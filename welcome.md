Welcome! 👋 I'm Rooban. Holding a passport that requires extra planning hasn't stopped me from doing my fair share of traveling! I've learned a lot navigating the world of visas and paperwork.

I'm building CrossBordersClub – a larger community and resource hub to make this easier for everyone.

For now, think of this chat as your AI companion. It uses insights gathered from real traveler experiences on communities like Reddit to help answer your questions on visas, passports, and immigration. Enjoy the assist! 🌍

🌱 **What's Coming**
CrossBordersClub is growing into a space where travelers can:
- Share visa application experiences
- Find support from fellow travelers
- Access practical resources and tips
- Connect with others facing similar challenges
- Contribute to making international travel more accessible

💫 **Our Vision**
Together, we're creating more than just a travel resource - we're building a movement that believes in breaking down barriers and making international travel accessible to everyone.

*Watch this space - exciting developments are coming soon!*
