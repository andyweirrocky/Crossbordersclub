# Project Brief: ADK Made Simple

## Project Overview
ADK Made Simple is a demonstration project showcasing agents built using the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK). The project focuses on creating Reddit-based agents that help users find information about visas, passports, and citizenship opportunities.

## Core Requirements
1. Develop and maintain two agent implementations:
   - Reddit Scout: Basic implementation for fetching Reddit discussions
   - Reddit Scout MCP: Enhanced version with Model Content Protocol (MCP)

2. Technical Requirements:
   - Implement using Google ADK (version >= 0.2.0)
   - Support real-time Reddit search functionality
   - Provide interactive chat interface
   - Ensure mobile-friendly design
   - Implement caching and performance optimization (MCP version)

3. Development Requirements:
   - Maintain clean, documented code
   - Support local development environment
   - Enable easy deployment to Streamlit Cloud
   - Provide comprehensive testing capabilities

## Project Goals
1. Demonstrate effective use of Google ADK
2. Showcase different agent implementation patterns
3. Provide a practical example of agent development
4. Enable easy comparison between basic and enhanced implementations

## Success Criteria
1. Both agents successfully fetch and process Reddit data
2. MCP version demonstrates improved performance through caching
3. User-friendly interface for interacting with agents
4. Comprehensive documentation and setup instructions
5. Successful deployment and operation on Streamlit Cloud
