# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
The ADK Made Simple project serves as a practical demonstration and learning resource for developers interested in building agents using the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK). It specifically addresses the need for:
1. Clear examples of ADK implementation
2. Comparison between basic and enhanced agent architectures
3. Practical demonstration of caching and performance optimization
4. Real-world application of agent development patterns

## Problems Solved
1. **Learning Curve**: Provides concrete examples of ADK implementation
2. **Performance Optimization**: Demonstrates how to implement efficient caching
3. **Development Patterns**: Shows different approaches to agent architecture
4. **Information Access**: Helps users find relevant visa and passport information

## How It Works
1. **Basic Agent (Reddit Scout)**:
   - Connects to Reddit API
   - Fetches recent discussions
   - Processes and presents information
   - Provides basic search functionality

2. **Enhanced Agent (Reddit Scout MCP)**:
   - Implements all basic agent features
   - Adds Model Content Protocol (MCP)
   - Implements configurable caching
   - Provides performance monitoring
   - Includes robust error handling

## User Experience Goals
1. **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and use
2. **Responsiveness**: Quick access to information
3. **Reliability**: Consistent performance
4. **Flexibility**: Configurable to different needs
5. **Educational**: Clear demonstration of concepts

## Target Users
1. Developers learning ADK
2. Users seeking visa/passport information
3. Technical educators
4. Agent development practitioners

## Key Features
1. Real-time Reddit search
2. Interactive chat interface
3. Mobile-friendly design
4. Configurable caching (MCP version)
5. Performance monitoring
6. Error handling and reporting
